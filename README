Description:

The shady-skin is a skin for Klaus Schmidingers VDR and Louis Brauns vdr-plugin-skindesigner.


1. Requirements:

	a. vdr-plugin-skindesigner
	
	b. Font: Open Sans, many other fonts are to fat and don't fit in some areas!
	
	c. A set of channellogos eg: http://creimer.net/channellogos/skindesigner-white-20150210.tar.bz2
	
	
2. Setup:

	a. Currently only one option can be set: "defaultcolumnwidth" yes or no.
	
		Preferably you test both settings with eg epgsearch-searchtimermenu or mailplugin which setting sweet your needs.
		
		If in doubt switch it to "no".



If you encounter any bugs, problems, or have any issues,

Have fun ;)
